# Airbnb_Copenhagen_Analysis
 This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a dataset of Airbnb listings in Copenhagen.  
Using Python and Pandas in a Jupyter Notebook, I removed unnecessary columns and filtered out listings with a price of 0.  
The cleaned data can now be used for further analysis, visualization, or machine learning models.

Tools used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub
